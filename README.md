# Facial Emotion Recognition Dataset
in this project  we worked on is Facial Emotion Recognition Image Dataset. <br/>
link : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tapakah68/facial-emotion-recognition <br/>

The dataset consists of images capturing people displaying 7 distinct emotions (anger, contempt, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise). Each image in the dataset represents one of these specific emotions. <br/>

we used 5 diffrent tools to see which would work best on classifying this data. <br/> 
while doing so we saw that the data isnt clear and has a lot of noise, we did our best to clean it. <br/> 

the results werent shocking: <br/> 
Decision tree : 0.34 <br/> 
KNN : 0.39 <br/> 
SVM : 0.41 <br/> 
Perceptron : 0.38 <br/> 
Ensemble learning : 0.44 <br/>
